<p>
The development of this project consists of creating a golang application with postgres so far I haven't implemented any authentication just some forms of architecture construction with interface
</p>


<h2>How to use</h2>

<p>

```

# Golang
- create database postgres with name tasks
- PAY ATTENTION (inside the helper folder there is a script for create table database in postgres script EX: Create Table.... file name help_data_base.go)
- env file copy and create a .env with database environents
- be careful with the comments // delete the env and leave only the information string
- there is a insominia go_flutter_api.json to you use if want

After that you have two choices use fresh to start or "go run main.go" inside root application
```
